.SH NAME
simple_shell \- simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
The simple_shell program is a minimal UNIX command interpreter written in C.
It reads commands from standard input, parses them, resolves executable paths,
creates child processes, and executes programs using execve.

The shell works in both interactive and non-interactive modes. In interactive
mode, it displays a prompt and waits for user input. In non-interactive mode,
it reads commands from standard input until EOF.

.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
When standard input is a terminal, the shell displays the prompt:
.PP
#cisfun$
.PP
The user may enter commands, which are executed immediately.

.SH NON-INTERACTIVE MODE
When input is piped or redirected, the shell reads and executes commands
without displaying a prompt.
.PP
Example:
.PP
echo "ls" | ./hsh

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
Commands are split into tokens separated by spaces or tabs. The first token is
treated as the command name.

If the command begins with '/', './', or '../', it is executed directly.
Otherwise, the shell searches for the command in the directories listed in the
PATH environment variable.

If the command is found, the shell forks a child process and executes it using:
.PP
execve(path, argv, env);

The parent process waits for the child to finish before reading the next input.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.SS exit
Exit the shell.
.PP
Usage:
.PP
The exit command terminates the shell.
.PP
The shell exits with status 0.

.SS env
Print the current environment variables.
.PP
Usage:
.PP
env

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable affects the behavior of the shell:

.TP
PATH
A colon-separated list of directories to search for executable commands.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The shell returns the exit status of the last executed command.

If a command is not found, the shell returns 127.

.SH ERROR HANDLING
If a command cannot be found, the shell prints an error message in the format:
.PP
./hsh: 1: command: not found
